Problem: Given $n$ points $p_i$, apply $m$ transformations to each of these points. Each transformation can be a shift, a scaling or a rotation around a given axis by a given angle. There is also a "loop" operation which applies a given list of transformations $k$ times ("loop" operations can be nested). You should apply all transformations faster than $O(n \cdot length)$, where $length$ is the total number of transformations to be applied (after unrolling "loop" operations).

Solution: Let's look at how the different types of transformations change the coordinates:

Shift operation: adds a different constant to each of the coordinates.
Scaling operation: multiplies each of the coordinates by a different constant.
Rotation operation: the transformation is more complicated (we won't go in details here), but each of the new coordinates still can be represented as a linear combination of the old ones.
As you can see, each of the transformations can be represented as a linear operation on the coordinates. Thus, a transformation can be written as a $4 \times 4$ matrix of the form:

$$\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_ {12} & a_ {13} & a_ {14} \\ a_{21} & a_ {22} & a_ {23} & a_ {24} \\ a_{31} & a_ {32} & a_ {33} & a_ {34} \\ a_{41} & a_ {42} & a_ {43} & a_ {44} \end{pmatrix}$$
that, when multiplied by a vector with the old coordinates and an unit gives a new vector with the new coordinates and an unit:

$$\begin{pmatrix} x & y & z & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_ {12} & a_ {13} & a_ {14} \\ a_{21} & a_ {22} & a_ {23} & a_ {24} \\ a_{31} & a_ {32} & a_ {33} & a_ {34} \\ a_{41} & a_ {42} & a_ {43} & a_ {44} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x' & y' & z' & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
(Why introduce a fictitious fourth coordinate, you ask? That is the beauty of homogeneous coordinates, which find great application in computer graphics. Without this, it would not be possible to implement affine operations like the shift operation as a single matrix multiplication, as it requires us to add a constant to the coordinates. The affine transformation becomes a linear transformation in the higher dimension!)

Here are some examples of how transformations are represented in matrix form:

Shift operation: shift $x$ coordinate by $5$, $y$ coordinate by $7$ and $z$ coordinate by $9$.
$$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 5 & 7 & 9 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
Scaling operation: scale the $x$ coordinate by $10$ and the other two by $5$.
$$\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 5 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
Rotation operation: rotate $\theta$ degrees around the $x$ axis following the right-hand rule (counter-clockwise direction).
$$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\ 0 & \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
Now, once every transformation is described as a matrix, the sequence of transformations can be described as a product of these matrices, and a "loop" of $k$ repetitions can be described as the matrix raised to the power of $k$ (which can be calculated using binary exponentiation in $O(\log{k})$). This way, the matrix which represents all transformations can be calculated first in $O(m \log{k})$, and then it can be applied to each of the $n$ points in $O(n)$ for a total complexity of $O(n + m \log{k})$.
